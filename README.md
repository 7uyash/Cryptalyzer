**Real-Time Cryptocurrency Market Sentiment Analyzer**

## Problem Statement

The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and heavily influenced by public sentiment expressed across social media platforms. Traders and investors often struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of information flow and the impact of collective emotions on market movements. There is a need for a tool that can aggregate, analyze, and present this sentiment data in real-time, allowing users to make informed decisions based on the emotional and psychological trends driving the market.

## Abstract

Cryptalyzer is a real-time cryptocurrency market sentiment analyzer designed to empower investors and traders with actionable insights into the emotional and psychological trends influencing the crypto market. By aggregating and interpreting data from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit, Cryptalyzer utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to gauge public sentiment toward various cryptocurrencies.

The platform securely integrates with the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange to fetch live market data, enabling users to correlate sentiment analysis with actual price movements. This fusion of social sentiment and market data provides a holistic view of the factors affecting cryptocurrency valuations.

Built with a robust tech stack—**Auth0** for secure user authentication, **MongoDB** for scalable data storage, and **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface—Cryptalyzer offers a seamless and personalized user experience. Users can log in to access customized dashboards, track their preferred cryptocurrencies, and receive real-time alerts on significant sentiment shifts or market fluctuations.

By transforming unstructured social media chatter into meaningful sentiment scores and visualizations, Cryptalyzer helps users anticipate market trends and make informed trading decisions. The platform serves as a critical tool for navigating the volatile crypto landscape, bridging the gap between raw data and strategic insight.

## Solution

Cryptalyzer addresses the problem by:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collecting real-time data from social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit using their respective APIs. Keywords and hashtags related to popular cryptocurrencies (e.g., #Bitcoin, #Ethereum) are used to fetch relevant posts.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing pre-trained natural language processing models like NLTK's VADER Sentiment Analyzer to evaluate the sentiment of each collected post. The sentiment scores range from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).

3. **Market Data Integration**: Fetching live cryptocurrency price data from the Gemini exchange through their public API. This data includes current prices, historical trends, and trading volumes for selected cryptocurrencies.

4. **Data Storage**: Storing collected data and analysis results in MongoDB, a flexible and scalable NoSQL database, which allows efficient querying and data retrieval.

5. **User Authentication**: Implementing secure user authentication using Auth0, enabling users to create accounts, log in securely, and have personalized settings and preferences.

6. **Interactive Dashboard**: Building a user-friendly interface with Streamlit, where users can:
   - View real-time sentiment scores and trends.
   - Correlate sentiment data with live market prices.
   - Customize their dashboard by selecting specific cryptocurrencies and time frames.
   - Receive alerts on significant changes in sentiment or price.

7. **Automated Data Refresh**: Setting up background tasks to continuously collect new data and update the dashboard in real-time, ensuring users have the most current information available.
